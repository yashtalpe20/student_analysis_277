# STUDENT PERFORMANCE PREDICTION & ANALYTICS SYSTEM
## Complete Ready-Made Project

### 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW
This is a comprehensive web application implementing Data Mining and Warehouse (DMW) concepts for educational analytics. The system predicts student performance, analyzes patterns, and provides actionable insights for educational institutions.

### 📊 ANALYSIS RESULTS FROM YOUR DATASET
- **Total Students Analyzed**: 1,194
- **Classification Accuracy**: 43.1% (Decision Tree)
- **Performance Distribution**: 
  - Distinction: 36.7% (438 students)
  - First Class: 34.0% (406 students)
  - Second Class: 21.7% (259 students)
  - Pass: 7.6% (91 students)

### 🔍 KEY INSIGHTS DISCOVERED
1. **Most Important Factors** (by feature importance):
   - Credits Completed (29.1%)
   - Family Income (13.3%)
   - Attendance (13.2%)
   - Social Media Usage (11.1%)
   - Current Semester (9.4%)

2. **Student Clusters Identified**:
   - Cluster 0: 596 students (Avg CGPA: 3.22, Attendance: 81.5%)
   - Cluster 1: 551 students (Avg CGPA: 3.36, Attendance: 95.0%)
   - Cluster 2: 47 students (Avg CGPA: 0.21, Attendance: 94.6%)

3. **Association Rules Found**:
   - High Attendance (≥85%) → Good Performance (Confidence: 75.7%)
   - High Study Hours (≥4) → High CGPA (≥3.5) (Confidence: 38.8%)
